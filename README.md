# C++ Coursework - Sophomore Year in Mechatronics Engineering

## Description

This repository contains the code and projects I worked on during my C++ course in my sophomore year studying Mechatronics Engineering. Here, you'll find a range of code samples spanning from foundational concepts like if conditions and loops, ideal for beginners, to more complex projects. Some of the code samples here have multiple solutions, showcasing different ways to approach and solve a problem.

## Usage

Each code file is accompanied by a brief comment at the beginning, describing its purpose and any specific considerations. If a code file has multiple solutions, they are either in separate files or divided by clear comments within the file.
